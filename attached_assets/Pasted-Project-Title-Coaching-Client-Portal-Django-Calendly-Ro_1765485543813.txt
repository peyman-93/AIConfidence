Project Title: Coaching Client Portal (Django + Calendly)

Role: Act as a Senior Python/Django Developer.

Objective: Build a secure client portal where users register, complete a survey, and access a dashboard. The dashboard will use Calendly for bookings/payments and Django Admin for backend management.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python (Django Framework).

Frontend: Django Templates (Standard HTML5 + Tailwind CSS).

Database: SQLite (Default for Django).

Authentication: Django's built-in Auth system.

Core Features & Logic:

User Authentication:

Standard Registration (Email, Password, Name) and Login pages.

Add a field to the User Model: promoter_code (Text, optional) to track who referred them.

The "Gatekeeper" (Survey):

Create a Survey model (Questions: Goals, Challenges, etc.).

Logic: When a user logs in, check if they have completed the Survey.

If No: Redirect them to the Survey Form. They cannot leave this page until submitted.

If Yes: Allow them to see the Dashboard.

The Dashboard (User View):

A clean HTML page using Tailwind CSS.

Top Section: "Welcome, [User Name]".

Middle Section (Booking):

Embed my Calendly Booking Widget here (Create a placeholder div where I can paste the code later).

Context: I will use Calendly to handle the payments (€100) and the "Round Robin" coach assignment.

Bottom Section (My Files):

Display a list of files linked to this user.

Columns: Date, File Name, Download Button.

The Admin Panel (For Me):

Enable the standard Django Admin (/admin).

File Uploads: Create a ClientFile model (Fields: User, File, Description, UploadDate).

Requirement: I must be able to log into the Admin Panel, select a specific User, and upload a PDF/Image for them. The user then sees this on their Dashboard.

Integration (Webhook):

Create a generic URL endpoint: /api/calendly-webhook/.

For now, just make it print the received JSON data to the console (print logs) so we can debug it later.

Instructions for Replit: Please set up the full Django project structure. Write the models.py first, then the views.py and urls.py. Finally, provide the HTML templates for the Login, Survey, and Dashboard.
